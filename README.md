# Messaging

This repository contains two RISCOS programs, !tweedledum and !tweedledee, that communicate with each other via wimp user messages. They are both essentially the same program, but with different names to make things as easy as possible.  Essentially this is just a fairly minimal example of message passing, left here in case I forget how it is done.
